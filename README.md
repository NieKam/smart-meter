# Smart Top Up

I was tired of having to remember to checkup balance on gas or electricity meters in my home in Ireland. I've created an app that computes daily consumption (based on user measurements) and send notification one day before approximated funds get expired. User can also check history, usage chart.

Don't neet to remember to check prepaid meters balance ðŸ‘¾
